Link to the dataset can be found on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce" style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;">Kaggle</a>. 

## Metrics & Dimensions Overview:
1) Key KPI Performances: Total Revenue, Transactions, Transacted Customers/Retailers, Average Basket Size (Monthly & Overall)
2) Geographical Insights: Region and State breakdown of transaction data 
3) Product Level Insights: Top product categories and products
4) Customer View: RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation of Customers
5) Retailer View: Retailer Network
6) B2B Marketing Leads Funnel

## Summary Insights
- Sales grew tremendously from 2016 to 2017 and broke $1,000,000 BRL in monthly revenue in Nov 2017. However, it has since slowed down in 2018.
- We see the highest transaction activity in the Southeast Region of Brazil with Sao Paolo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and Minas Gerais (MG). This is not surprising as these three states are of the richest in Brazil
- The top product category is 'Health & Beauty' and 'Bed,Bath & Table', accounting for almost 9% of total revenue each
- From the RFM analysis, we see that customers have transacted only once in their lifetime, suggesting a low stickiness and loyalty to the platform
- The largest retailer network is 1.8K transacted customers but only 7% of the transacted retailers had >100 customers
- B2B Marketing lead campaigns started from 2017 and lead conversion rate has improved from 2% to 12% (2017 Q3 to 2018 Q2). In total, there were 842 closed leads that generated $793,000 BRL revenue. 55% of closed leads came from organic/paid search.

## Recommendations
- Improve user retention and returning transactions by offering more discount campaigns to customers.
- Continue to strategically target richer states and blast product category specific ads to customers based on their past transaction behaviour. To streamline marketing efforts, additional reminder campaigns can be given to customer segments with higher Recency and Monetary Scores (4-5)
- Make use of the retailer network analysis to encourage high performing retailers with better commission rates.
- Ensure that key word optimisation strategies are used to improve lead generation for B2B campaigns
